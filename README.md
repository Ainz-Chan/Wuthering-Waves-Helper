# Wuthering Waves Helper

Wuthering Waves Helper is an event and redemption code tracker app written in `Kotlin` for [**Wuthering Waves**](https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/).

The events are scraped from [WutheringWaves.gg](https://wutheringwaves.gg/news/event/) while the codes are scraped from [Game8.com](https://game8.co/games/Wuthering-Waves/) using my [data-scraper-for-wuthering-waves-helper](https://github.com/jeryjs/Wuthering-Waves-Helper/tree/main/data-scraper) script with github actions.

This is an adaptation of my [Honkai: Star Rail Helper](https://github.com/jeryjs/Star-Rail-Helper) app for Wuthering Waves, but should eventually become its own uniqe app!! ~~hopefully?~~
